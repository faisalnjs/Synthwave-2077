Disclaimer - This theme, Synthwave 2077, was created by SBigz (CodeSasha) and this is just a fork of his repo [SBigz/Synthwave-2077](https://github.com/SBigz/Synthwave-2077) made due to it being incompatible with the latest VSCode version. I loved how it looked at first sight, and was heartbroken when I saw that I couldn't use it. CodeSasha, if you see this, please email me so I can merge the repos and delete mine. Thanks for your hard work!
